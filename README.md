# ECEF-Coordinate-System

## Axient Software Engineer Project Request
### Project 1: Mathematical Programming

 Implement a small Java program that can accept a csv file containing trajectory states in ECEF coordinates and append new columns containing various orbital parameters. An input file will be provided with 6 columns containing ECEF position (E, F, G) in meters and velocity (Edot, Fdot, Gdot) in meters per second. The output should contain the original 6 columns, with additional columns added for eccentricity (unitless), semimajor axis (meters) and inclination (radians). Assume the WGS84 Earth model. Attached you will find example input (states.csv) and output (out_states.csv) files.  Please submit your source code as single .zip file and include a README.md file with steps to execute.
